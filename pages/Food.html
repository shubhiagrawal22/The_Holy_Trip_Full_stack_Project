      <p>
        Being one of the holy cities of India, Mathura is devoid of any kind of
        non-vegetarian food. Food here are mostly satvik (devoid of onion,
        garlic) (devoid of onion, garlic). As makhan (white butter) is supposed
        to be Lord Krishna's favourite snack, milk and milk products form
        extensive part of the delicacies of this city.

      <h2><u>Peda</u></h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to Mathura meals, the first item that comes to mind is
        Peda. The peda sweet is known by the brand name Mathura. It is prepared
        for Lord Krishna as a bhog (offering). It's a creamy caramelised milk
        reduction with a hint of cardamom and ghee that gives the sweet a rich
        flavour.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Makhan Mishri</u></h2>
      <p>
        Lord Krishna is also known as'makhan chor,' which gives rise to the word
        makhan mishri. Makhan mishri (sweetened white butter) is white butter
        served in a tiny earthen pot with mishri (sugar candy) on top. Mother
        Yashoda is said to have fed her Balgopal his favourite makhan mishri
        every day.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Kachori and Jalebi</u></h2>
      <p>
        If you're visiting Mathura, kachori and jalebi are a must-try. These
        flat kachoris are drenched in desi ghee and served with aloo ki sabzi
        (potato curry). The intense hing (asafoetida) flavour in the kachoris is
        the nicest part. Without crispy, hot jalebis drizzled in syrup, this
        spicy kachori delight is incomplete.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Ghewar</u></h2>
      <p>
        You might not be able to get ghewar for the entire year. During the
        monsoon season, it is prepared. Ghewar is a sugar-soaked disc-shaped
        sweet cake made with maida (all-purpose flour). Mathura's Ghewar is
        distinguished by its layers of malai and dry fruits.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Lassi</u></h2>
      <p>
        Mathura's food is dominated by milk, whether in its natural state or as
        a product. If you're lactose-intolerant, kadhai wale doodh will be
        heaven for you. It's just milk that's been boiled all day in an iron
        kadhai and then topped with a coating of malai. Rabri is another popular
        Mathura delicacy. It consists of condensed milk served in an earthen pot
        with kesar, spices, and nuts. The link between rabri and jalebi is
        unbreakable. And, of course, when it comes to milk products, we can't
        forget about lassi, a glass of bliss with a generous helping of rich
        malai. After drinking a glass of lassi, make sure you have a milk
        moustache on your face.
