          A little town called Gokul, located near Mathura and Vrindavan, is
          where Hindu God Krishna spent his infancy. As a result, Gokul
          continues to be an important Hindu pilgrimage site in India. Lord
          Krishna was born at Nathdwara to Devaki and King Vasudev, according to
          Hindu mythology. His father, King Vasudev, transported him to Gokul to
          the residence of Nanda and Yashoda, who became his foster parents, in
          order to protect him from his maternal uncle, who wished to kill him.

            <h2>Shri Thakurani Ghat</h2>
            <p>
              Shri Thakur Rani Ghat is one of Gokul's most holy sites, and its
              history, as well as some mythology, play an important role.
              Vallabhacharya was said to have received the darshan (divine
              manifestation) of Goddess Yamuna here, according to legend. He
              then praised her by performing the Yamunashtakam (a devotional
              song).This location is linked to a significant historical event in
              the life of Vallabhacharya, a great Hindu theologian, philosopher,
              and saint. This is one of the best places in Uttar Pradesh to go
              if you want to get some peace and quiet and lose yourself in
              meditation.

            <h2>Nand Bhavan</h2>
            <p>
              The Chaurasi Khamba Temple, also known as Nand Bhawan, is one of
              Gokul's most popular tourist sites. It attracts visitors and
              devotees since it was here that Lord Krishna spent his infancy
              days after King Kansa imprisoned his true parents. The residence
              belongs to Nand Maharaj, Lord Krishna's foster father. The temple
              is known as Chaurasi Khamba temple because it is supported by 84
              pillars.

            <h2>Raman Reti</h2>
            <p>
              Raman Reti, commonly known as Raman Van, is a town in Mathura's
              eastern region. This Gokul attraction has a particular place in
              the hearts and imaginations of the inhabitants. It was here that
              Lord Krishna spent his youth days having pleasure and frolic with
              Balarama and their companions. An unusual note about this location
              is that instead of customary colours, the Hindu holiday of Holi is
              celebrated here with sand. In close proximity to the shrine is a
              deer park with ostriches and ducks. In the temple compound, there
              are several huts belonging to sadhus and sanyasis.
