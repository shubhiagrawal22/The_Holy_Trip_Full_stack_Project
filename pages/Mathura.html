          Mathura is an important place of pilgrimage in India as it is the birth place of Lord Krishna. 
          Mathura is one of the most sacred cities of Hinduism and is situated on the western banks of the
          Yamuna River. The thousands of devotees visit this place throughout the year. It lies at the heart
          of the Brajbhoomi, a land that is imbued with sanctity, for it was here that the young Krishna was
          nurtured. The little towns and hamlets in this area are still alive with the tales of his
          mischievous pranks, his extraordinary exploits and still seem to echo with the sound of his flute.
          Today, Mathura with its many temples and splendid ghats along the Yamuna river, is an important
          pilgrimage town. It is also a rapidly growing industrial city. Hindi, English and Brajbhasha are
          the main languages which are spoken in Mathura.

            <p>
              The most famous of Mathura’s temples is the Krishna Janmasthan Temple,
              built around the prison cell where Krishna was born after his parents were imprisoned
              by his evil uncle, Kansa, King of Mathura. One of the most venerated shrines in India,
              the temple complex is located west of Mathura’s old city and thronged by pilgrims’
              through-out the year, whose number increases exponentially during festivals. 
              It is believed that there was a massive idol of Krishna, over 4m tall and made of solid gold,
              which was stolen during an attack by Mahmud of Ghazni. 
              The present Krishna Janmasthan Temple complex is fairly new.

              and murals. Lord Dwarkadheesh, a form of Lord Krishna known as Dwarkanath, sits like a black 
              marble idol in the shrine.There are a plethora of stunning ceiling paintings depicting various
              elements of the Lord's life. In addition, the beautiful Rajasthani architectural patterns and 
              craftsmanship make the complex appear even more majestic. The Dwarkadhish temple offers you

              Jai Guru Dev Ashram in the holy city of Mathura is the pilgrimage centre that attracts people 
              from all over the world. This was constructed in remembrance of Pandit Ghurelal Sharma Ji by
              his disciple Baba Jai Gurudev. Baba Jai Gurudev’s early name was Tulsidas Maharaj and was a
              religious leader in the northern part of India and revered by both Hindus and Muslims as a
              Saint.The architecture of Jai Gurudev Temple resembles that of the Taj Mahal being built with 
              white marbles but if seen in close quarters one will notice the difference. This beautiful temple
              complex is made of domed structures and minarets entirely of white marble and based on Hindu
              architecture.

              Tapobhumi on the Chamunda Devi Marg on Mathura Vrindavan road. It is believed that a hair
              strand of Mother Bhagwati Jagdamba fell at this sacred spot. Also, according to Srimad Bhagwat,
              Sri Krishna visited Chamunda Devi Temple after liberating the dragon. The main highlight of the
              temple is that there is no idol of Maa Chamunda inside.It is believed in Satyug Lord Krishna offered
              salvation to a python after which he went to seek blessings from Maa Chamunda here.
