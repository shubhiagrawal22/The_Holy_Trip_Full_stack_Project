          A little town called Gokul, located near Mathura and Vrindavan, is
          where Hindu God Krishna spent his infancy. As a result, Gokul
          continues to be an important Hindu pilgrimage site in India. Lord
          Krishna was born at Nathdwara to Devaki and King Vasudev, according to
          Hindu mythology. His father, King Vasudev, transported him to Gokul to
          the residence of Nanda and Yashoda, who became his foster parents, in
          order to protect him from his maternal uncle, who wished to kill him.

            <p>
              Shri Thakur Rani Ghat is one of Gokul's most holy sites, and its
              history, as well as some mythology, play an important role.
              Vallabhacharya was said to have received the darshan (divine
              manifestation) of Goddess Yamuna here, according to legend. He
              then praised her by performing the Yamunashtakam (a devotional
              song).This location is linked to a significant historical event in
              the life of Vallabhacharya, a great Hindu theologian, philosopher,
              and saint. This is one of the best places in Uttar Pradesh to go
              if you want to get some peace and quiet and lose yourself in
              meditation.

            <h2>Nand Bhavan</h2>
            <p>
              The Chaurasi Khamba Temple, also known as Nand Bhawan, is one of
              Gokul's most popular tourist sites. It attracts visitors and
              devotees since it was here that Lord Krishna spent his infancy
              days after King Kansa imprisoned his true parents. The residence
              belongs to Nand Maharaj, Lord Krishna's foster father. The temple
              is known as Chaurasi Khamba temple because it is supported by 84
              pillars. The number 84 represents the 84,00,000 species of life in
              the material universe, according to Hindu holy traditions. As a
              result, the pillars are thought to hold all of the universe's life
              when taken together. A massive banyan tree can be found in the
              temple's courtyard. Visitors to the temple tie colourful ribbons
              to the temple's branches in the hopes of bringing them good luck
              and success. There is a Kali Maa shrine under the banyan tree. The
              old pillars and brackets contribute significantly to the temple's
              timeless ambience.

            <h2>Raman Reti</h2>
            <p>
              Raman Reti, commonly known as Raman Van, is a town in Mathura's
              eastern region. This Gokul attraction has a particular place in
              the hearts and imaginations of the inhabitants. It was here that
              Lord Krishna spent his youth days having pleasure and frolic with
              Balarama and their companions. An unusual note about this location
              is that instead of customary colours, the Hindu holiday of Holi is
              celebrated here with sand. In close proximity to the shrine is a
              deer park with ostriches and ducks. In the temple compound, there
              are several huts belonging to sadhus and sanyasis. It is believed
              that Yashoda, Krishna’s foster mother, would send him along with
              his friends to the forest for various household chores. However,
              Krishna, being the mischievous lad that he was, would escape to
              this place and spend the entire day rolling in its extremely soft
              sand.

            <h2>Brahmand Ghat</h2>
            <p>
              Devotees at this sacred place adore the earth where Lord Krishna
              is said to have touched and consumed it. They also take away mud
              packages, which are thought to bring good fortune and success. It
              is thought that smearing it will cure fatal ailments. The Brahmand
              Temple, which overlooks the Yamuna River and is dedicated to a
              specific episode in Krishna's life, is located next to the ghat. A
              peepal tree can also be found in the temple complex. Female temple
              visitors wrap a ribbon around the temple's branches to wish their
              husbands a long life. with the average temperature being 42°C. If
              you can cope with the heat, then summers is as fine a time as many
              to visit this place. However, if you prefer the cool and pleasant
              weather, then there is no time better than winters

            <h2>GokulNath Ji Temple</h2>
            <p>
              The Gokulnathji Temple is one of Gokul's most popular religious
              locations. With its massive shikhara, the temple stands out
              (central tower). Mansi Ganga, which runs alongside the shrine, is
              a draw in and of itself. This water tank is linked to a
              fascinating legendary storey. The Gokulnath Temple is thought to
              mark the end of the Govardhan Parikrama. In the temple, Shri
              Krishna is worshipped beside Giriraj Maharaja (Mount Govardhan).
              The temple is packed with tourists during the Janmashtami,
              Annakut, and Trinvat Mela festivals.
